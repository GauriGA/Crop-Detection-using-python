# Crop Detection Using Python

https://github.com/GauriGA/Crop-Detection-using-python

## Abstract
India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to increase productivity and raise profitability use of modern technology (Artificial Intelligence) is the need of the hour. We developed a simple python-based project which recommends the best crop to grow on the basis of weather predictions. This system is available 24\*7, can be accessed through any electronic device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. Dataset updates itself whenever we run the program. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier information about suitable crops to grow and hence a better agricultural output.
